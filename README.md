# Data-Visualisation
This is the code for a data visualisation website: https://cci.arts.ac.uk/~vstamova/datavis/ 

I have created a data visualisation website that shows some of the biggest companies and their revenues before and after Covid19. There are 3 different visualisations the users can view - the first one is a bubble chart representing the revenues as circles before and after, the second one is a bar graph with just 6 companies from different industries where 3 of them have losses and 3 of them have gained from covid, and the third is data scraped from a financial website showing the stock prices in real time.
